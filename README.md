### Hi there 👋

### About Me and What I do 🕴

My name is Maurizio. I am a professional full-stack Software Engineer.

I am deeply interested and actively working on improving my skills in the following technologies: Typescript, ReactJS, NodeJS,C# / .Net, GraphQL.

I have worked with several businesses and startups that I helped by developing web apps to strengthen their businesses. When I’m not designing or developing, in my free time I like to research the latest in developing trends to increase my productivity and sharpen my professional tool kit.

It’s not all business though, I have a strong passion for photography and I like exercise to keep myself in good shape, physically and mental.
